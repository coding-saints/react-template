### Step 1: CLONE

Clone or download to local machine and open up to the ``` package.json ``` file to look at the scripts I have set up. 

### Step 2: npm install

type: ``` npm i ``` to install dependencies.

### Step 3: RUN

There are a few commands to choose. Open your terminal (vs-code users hold **CTRL** + **\`** ) and type: `` `npm run build `` to generate the code from the **src** folder into a new folder called **dist** in the root of the application.

After everything works, type: ``` npm run dev ``` .Webpack-dev-server will start up and your browser will open a new tab automatically to view the app.
